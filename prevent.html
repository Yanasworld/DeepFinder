<h1> What is the Problem?</h1>
<div class="container">
<p> Misinformation has become a significant challenge in public health, causing a range of negative consequences such as the spread of diseases, low vaccination rates, and increased anxiety and confusion among the public. Misinformation in the context of public health can take many forms, including conspiracy theories, false claims about the efficacy of treatments, and inaccurate information about the causes of diseases. As of recent years, misinformation has risen up in the form of deep fakes. As a result, it is crucial to address this problem and find effective strategies to combat the spread of misinformation to prevent the possibility of people believing false information which will improve public health outcomes.</p>

<p2 style="color:green; font-family:verdana; font-size:150%; text-align: center;">“Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health. It can cause confusion, sow mistrust, harm people’s health, and undermine public health efforts.”<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/health-misinformation/index.html">—Dr. Vivek H. Murthy Surgeon General of the United States</a> </p2>

<h1> Improvements </h1>
<div class="container">
  <h1>Enhance Health Literacy</h1>
<p>One way to prevent the spread of misinformation is by promoting health literacy. Healthcare providers can educate patients on how to identify reliable sources of information, such as peer-reviewed scientific studies or reputable medical organizations. Additionally, promoting critical thinking skills can help patients evaluate health claims and distinguish between credible information and misinformation.By implementing better health literacy this could improve public health because people will understand what is factual and what is false. By knowing what is factual the public would do more vaccines and things which would improve their health and others.</p>

<br>
<h1>Developing Fact-Checking Tools</h1>
<p>Developing fact-checking tools can help healthcare providers and patients verify the accuracy of information they encounter. Fact-checking tools can be integrated into search engines or social media platforms to provide real-time information on the credibility of the information.By implementing fact-checking tools into the media, this would help improve public health because it would allow people to know what is factual compared to what is false. By having a easy way to tell what resources are credible,it would allow for people to believe that things such as vaccines and other healh related information better, which would improve the well-being of the public.</p>
<p2 style="color:green; font-family:verdana; font-size:150%; text-align: center;">"Fact-checking is important because misinformation can sway your opinion. In turn, your opinion can largely inform your actions. If you base your actions on false information, you can easily make the wrong decisions. These decisions can lead to unintended consequences."<a href="https://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/masters-public-administration/guide-to-misinformation-and-fact-checking/#:~:text=Fact-checking%20is%20important%20because,can%20lead%20to%20unintended%20consequences">-Ohio University</a> </p2>
  <br>
<h1>Encourage Transparency</h1>
<p>Encouraging transparency in the healthcare industry is vital to help prevent the spread of misinformation. This can include publishing accurate data on the safety and effectiveness of treatments, making clinical trial data available to the public, and providing clear and concise communication about health risks and benefits. Healthcare providers and organizations can also collaborate to establish guidelines for ethical and accurate communication of health information. By having better transparency in healthcare, it would improve the public health because it would allow people to have data exactly from the hospital it would make people believe things such as vaccines and other healthcare information which would improve their well-being and others.</p>
<p2 style="color:green; font-family:verdana; font-size:150%; text-align: center;">"Data sharing help clinical investigators to weigh and/or substantiate the clinical question and share thought processes, potentiating scientific research, strengthening collaborations between multiple stakeholders, enhancing integrity and trust in clinical research among the general public, patients, and physicians." -<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799949/">Mohit Joshi</a></p2>

<h1>How would this Effect Misinformation?</h1>
<div class="container">
<p>Enhancing our ability to discern fact from fiction could play a crucial role in combating the pervasive issue of fake news and misinformation in the media. With approximately 86% of Americans now turning to the internet and digital devices for their news, the rise of social media has created a platform for the easy dissemination of false information. A staggering three in four Americans overestimate their capacity to identify false headlines, and the more ill-equipped they are to do so, the more likely they are to propagate fake news (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/31/health/fake-news-study/index.html">CNN, 2022</a>). Consequently, improving our media literacy is imperative to halting the spread of misinformation. A shocking 67% of Americans have encountered fake news on social media, and 10% of adults in the U.S. have even shared it knowingly (<a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2021-11-09/study-shows-verified-users-are-among-biggest-culprits-when-it-comes-sharing-fake">Temple University</a>). Given the prevalence of such misleading information, developing fact-checking skills and improving our ability to discern the credibility of sources could significantly decrease the spread of false information.</p>
