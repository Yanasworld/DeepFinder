<h1>Deep Finder</h1>
<p>Deep-Finder is a student created website which was designed to propose a solution to the ever-evolving technology of deep-faking. This website gives a simple solution to prevent deep-fake technology from using our users’ images and information on the dangers of deep-fakes and misinformation in healthcare so we can spread the awareness of such dangers. This website is a place to help and protect people from the dangers of deep-faking technology. </p>
</div> 
<h1>What is deep Faking? </h1>
<div class="container">
<p> Deepfakes are realistic, computer-generated videos, images, or audio recordings that are designed to appear authentic and genuine but are fabricated or altered. Deepfakes use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to manipulate existing video or audio recordings and create new ones that appear authentic.</p>
<div style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; background-color: #398a42; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 12px;"> <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wq-kmFCrF5Q" title="DeepTomCruise Tiktok Breakdown" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>This video here by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq-kmFCrF5Q" style="color: #fff;">VFXChris Ume</a> shows a deep fake of Tom Cruise that went viral all over tiktok.</p> </div>
</div>

<h1>How do Deep-Fakes Work?</h1>
<div class="container">
<p>
  Deepfakes work by using advanced machine learning techniques to generate synthetic content that appears to be authentic. Typically, a deepfake algorithm uses a neural network to analyze and manipulate existing video or image footage of a person or object to create a new version that appears to be genuine.
  <br>
  To create a deepfake video, the algorithm uses a process called "generative adversarial networks" (GANs), where two neural networks are trained simultaneously. One network, called the "generator," creates the fake content, while the other network, called the "discriminator," tries to detect whether the content is real or fake. The generator keeps improving its output until the discriminator can no longer tell the difference between the fake and real content.
</p>
</div>
<h1> How can Deep-Fakes be dangerous?</h1>
<div class="container">
<p> The use of deepfakes can cause significant harm by spreading misinformation and disinformation. Here are some ways that deepfakes can cause misinformation:
<br><br>
  <h2>1. Spreading false narratives</h2>Deepfakes can be used to create fake news stories or videos that support a particular agenda. These videos can be shared on social media, where they can quickly go viral and influence public opinion.
  <br><br>
  <h2>2. Political manipulation</h2>Deepfakes can be used to manipulate the outcome of elections or other political events by creating fake videos that show politicians or candidates saying or doing something they did not actually do.
  <br><br>
  <h2>3. Reputation damage</h2>Deepfakes can be used to damage the reputation of an individual or organization by creating a fake video or audio that appears to be genuine but is actually fabricated. This can have significant consequences for the person or organization involved.
  <br><br>
  <h2>4. Legal implications</h2>Deepfakes can be used to create false evidence, which can have legal implications. For example, a deepfake video could be used to falsely incriminate an innocent person or exonerate a guilty one.
  
  Overall, deepfakes can cause significant harm by spreading false information and manipulating public opinion. As the technology behind deepfakes continues to advance, it is essential to develop effective strategies to detect and combat this kind of misinformation.</p>

<h1> Why do we want to solve this?</h1>
<div class="container">
<p>We would like to put an end to the harm of deep fakes because people use them for the wrong thing. In politics, people use to have their political gains. An article online called <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/news/deep-fakes-fake-news-and-what-comes-next/">Jsis Washington Education</a> by Sean Dack, explains how it creates a problem by reshaping information and warfare. “Information warfare, or targeted misinformation campaigns designed to confuse and obfuscate for political gain, are nothing new. Disinformation and so-called fake news have been around for generations. Here disinformation is defined as intentional falsehoods spread as actual news designed to advance a political goal.” This explains how things like disinformation which is a form of deep fakes confuse people only for political gain and misinformation has been a problem for a long time, but in politics, the deep fakes are only used to create a political gain for one candidate over the other.
to create a political  gain for one candidate over the other.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Another article called <a href="https://apo.org.au/node/259911?utm_source=APO-feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=rss-all">APO</a> says that deep fakes are an assault on commonly held standards of evidence used to spread fake news. 
    “News coverage claims that deep fakes are poised to assault commonly held standards of evidence, that they are the harbingers of a coming “information apocalypse.”The article finally talks about how it affects politics and other things as well. “Both deep fakes and cheap fakes are capable of blurring the line between expression and evidence.
     Both can be used to influence the politics of evidence: how evidence changes and is changed by its existence in cultural, social, and political structures.” This explains how it creates a problem in our society and especially politics today.</p>
