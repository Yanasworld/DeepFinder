<h1>What are our Values and Principles?</h1>
<div class="container">
  <p>Our values and principles are to help everyone and prevent the harm of innocent people. We created this website as a way to demonstrate our values and principles by spreading awareness of the dangers of deep-faking and misinformation. Deep-faking goes against our principles and affects the lives of innocent people by spreading misinformation or ruining innocent peoples reputations. This is why we are trying help prevent such deep-fake crimes from happening. </p>
</div>
<h1> How did we get to where we are?</h1>
<div class="container">
  <p>We created this website from a project assigned to us for our GT Block Class. The point of our project was to solve a major problem in a field that we were hoping to pursue. We choose deep-faking and misinformation because it incorporates both I.T. and healthcare. We have spent two months creating this website. Most of it was spent coding the watermark creator in java script, which was done by Jamal. This website is a representation of both of ours knowledge in HTML, java script, and research. This website took a lot of hard work and went above our expectations. We started off this idea after watching and researching about deeps fakes, and how they create a divison in society.
    Many people are harmed from these deep fakes as we said in the medical field and even politics. It creates a harm for people
    and we would like to put an end to this or at least contribute to a solution. </p>
